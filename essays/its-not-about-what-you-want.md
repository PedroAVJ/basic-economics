# It's Not About What You Want

❌ If you could go inside someone's head and listen to their thoughts, you'll notice that the majority of their thoughts are related to what they want.

❌ This probably applies to what people talk about too, it's almost always focused on complaints about prices, or build quality.

❌ So are people's actions, for example, people tend to apply to jobs if they deem the pay and benefits to their liking, instead of whether or not they meet the requirements.

❌ At best, this is wishful thinking.

❌ At worst, this misdirection costs people's time.

❌ It is a much better use of one's time if one focused on what people want, instead

❌ For example, let's say you wanted to grow your network, the wrong way to approach this is to think "man, I would love to connect with x, y, or z", and instead you should think, what value am I adding to the other person in return for being part of my network?
