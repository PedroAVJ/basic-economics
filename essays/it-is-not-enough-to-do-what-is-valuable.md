# You Must Resist Doing What Is Not

❌ The first impulse that comes to mind is usually a reflection of easy desires, not deliberate objectives.

❌ When we react impulsively, we end up doing things we do not actually endorse in the long run.

❌ This leads to regrets, wasted energy, and unproductive outcomes.

❌ Instead, we want to train ourselves to spot these impulses and decide consciously whether they're aligned with our deeper goals.

❌ By resisting the urge to do what doesn't serve us, we free up time and focus for more meaningful pursuits.

❌ It's almost like building a mental firewall to filter out thoughts that derail us from progress.

❌ Ask yourself, "Will this bring me closer to the person I want to be?" before proceeding.

❌ Turn your attention away from momentary pleasures or unproductive tasks.

❌ Cultivate a sense of clarity in your daily routine that helps you distinguish between the plausible and the pointless.

❌ When we develop this intentional practice of saying no to what is not, we increase our capacity to say yes to what matters.
